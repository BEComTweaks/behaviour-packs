## This would not have been possible if not for the following

### Websites<br>
<br>[Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net)<br>
- Without them, Bedrock Tweaks would have not been this way
<br>[Bedrock Tweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net)<br>
- Without DrAV, this would have taken a long time to complete

### Individuals<br>
[YzaBeast1](https://github.com/yzabeast1)<br>
- Pointed out issues with my code preventing Linux Distributions from running the scripts<br>
- Made the webUI and backend if we host it
<br>[NSPC911](https://github.com/NSPC911)<br>
- Yep, that's me, the one who started this all!
