A repo containing every single tweak **possible** ported from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks">Vanilla Tweaks' Data-Packs</a> with a Command Line and Web Interface.

How to clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/behaviour-packs/
cd behaviour-packs/pys
echo 0 | python3 folder_creator.py
```
<sub>echo is to instantly start the script with no printing.</sub>

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
